# LeetCode Solutions
I am working through the LeetCode problem-set and keeping track of my answers in this repository.

## LeetPython
This is the folder containing all of the solutions I have so-far found, written in Python.

## LeetJava
This folder contains solutions written in Java.
The files of interest can be found in the "src" folder.
I have also started writing a package ("Resources"), which is helping me to improve my understanding of how Java works.
